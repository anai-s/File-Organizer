# File-Organizer
File Organizer is my first python basic project. I developped this project because I downloaded a lot of files every week but I like to have everything organize in my computer so I wanted to automate and schedule the day when I sort my new files, so the future me will say thanks you and won't do it manually.
It's a python project who will help you sort the files in your choosen folder. 
To run this project download the file-organizer folder, you will have to change the value of some variables and then run the script *__init__.py*.  
Optional: 
- if there is some files to sort manually you can send you an email to remind you to do it. if you don't want to do it you can delete the file *send_email.py* and *email_info.py*. 
- I created a Windows Task Scheduler task on my computer so my local python script *__init__.py* will be triggered every week and send me a reminder to organize that I have download.
